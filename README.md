# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This app uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

DEV requirements (testing libs):
```
pip3 install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

To launch unit tests, use pytest:
```
python -m pytest openapi_server
```

Typing checks:
```
mypy openapi_server/
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```

## Adding new endpoints

1. Edit `bq-api-spec.yaml` according to [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/).

2. You can check/debug it [here](https://editor.swagger.io/).

3. Run this command:
```
openapi-generator generate -i bq-api-spec.yaml -g python-flask -o . -s
```
it will create endpoints, models, controller stubs and documentation.

`-s` flag will prevent your code from being overwritten.

*[Julia] When i run this command, documentation is not correctly created, to bypass it,
I run this command in an empty project without `-s` flag and then copy-paste file contents.*

*Dear reader, if you know the better way to do this, please update this doc.*
